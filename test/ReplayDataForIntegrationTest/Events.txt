Apparently there is a little bit of manual work needed to get them to build.\r\nb) It looks like there is a bug in the package gnome-pkg-tools which prevents pbuilder from automatically installing the build dependencies because of a blank line in the debian/control file. I've opened a bug for that: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-pkg-tools/+bug/953392\r\n\r\nIn the end it doesn't really matter what you are using to build packages as long as it works and doesn't mess up your machine. For publicly posted build instructions I would recommend to use Pbuilder because it is easier to get rid of the build dependencies again.\r\n\r\nBtw: what did you mean with your last sentence: How about getting Cinnamon a sponsor upstream? I didn't get that one...

opennaas naming scheme\n\nThe patch adjusts the feature names to avoid the name 'mantychore'. All\nfeature names are prefixed opennaas- (with a couple of exceptions for\ntest bundles).\n\nI am not using the proposed opennaas-extensions- prefix for feature\nnames as it would make the names unusually long compared to other\nServiceMix feature names. Prefixing with opennaas- should be enough to\nmake the names fairly unique.\n\nI renamed mantychore-base to mantychore-cim as the feature is about\nrepresenting the CIM model. In its current form the feature also holds\nthe network model, but this is because the dependency between the two is\nupside down. Once the dependency has been inverted the network model\nbundle should be moved to the network feature. Similarly the\nqueuemanager bundle should be part of opennaas-core, but the bundle\nneeds to be renamed and moved first.\n\nThe opennaas-luminis feature should possibly be split and renamed, but\nfor now I have put those bundles into a single feature."}],"ref":"refs/heads/feature/refactor-feature-repositories"},"id":"1529213671"},{"repo":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mnfienen/cida_emu_util","id":3411130,"name":"mnfienen/cida_emu_util"},"type":"PushEvent","created_at":"2012-03-12T20:39:43Z","org":{"url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/"},"public":true,"actor":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnfienen","gravatar_id":"866ae687672876520ef81fbde202d3b5","id":1110827,"login":"mnfienen"},"payload":{"head":"736e00c35dd63667f5b08cf53c2bc08f8f756d9c","size":1,"push_id":66899698,"commits":[{"sha":"736e00c35dd63667f5b08cf53c2bc08f8f756d9c","author":{"name":"Mike

I will help you with you questions.  First though I want to confirm your concern about our Flash API.  The Flash API is less mature than our Objective-C, Java, Android, JavaScript and other popular APIs.  The good news is that the API, like you said, is fairly strait forward.  That said, we have not provided extensive tests for the Flash API, as it is in low demand.  However we want to provide you the information you need to get started quickly on a path to stable API.  \r\n\r\nThe best way to get started with the Flash API is to confirm that the logic written in Action Script actually fits our HTTP Rest API: http://www.pubnub.com/tutorial/http-rest-push-api and a much more extensive guide may be found here: https://github.com/pubnub/pubnub-api/blob/master/README.md\r\n\r\nYou may want to write your own wrapper to this HTTP Rest API!  And you'll find out that it is fairly quick to do.  Though I recommend upgrading the Flash API by fixing the parts that are not working for you.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I recommend checking out the WIKI Posted API for Flash here - http://www.wikiflashed.com/wiki/PubNub - which you may have already seen.\r\n\r\nSo I gave you three new pathways to provide a fix for your situation.\r\nWrite your own wrapper using the PubNub HTTP Rest API\r\nUpgrading the Current API to support your needs.\r\nChecking out the Third Party API on the Wiki.\r\nLet me know if this gets you further down the line.  We do not support flash, however I will be here to provide helpful details with regards on connecting to the PubNub Cloud via the HTTP Rest API.  :-)","updated_at":"2012-03-12T20:39:22Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pubnub/pubnub-api/issues/comments/4461156","id":4461156,"user":{"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b4ddb8b9c296ecf6a7cc338da508f98?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","gravatar_id":"3b4ddb8b9c296ecf6a7cc338da508f98","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenlb","id":45214,"login":"stephenlb"}},"action":"created","issue":{"number":79,"created_at":"2012-03-12T11:14:50Z","pull_request":{"diff_url":null,"patch_url":null,"html_url":null},"comments":2,"body":"I have created a Flash client using the provided PubNub SDK.
